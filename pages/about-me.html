            Hi, I'm Cosmo, the main driving force behind Atlas_Cosmo. Atlas_Cosmo is the collective name for all the work I do as a composer and sound designer, creating electronic
            music for video games. 
            I was raised as a musician, its something I've done my whole life and something I'd love to continue to do.

            I'm proficient in a few different instruments and have been learning the piano since I was 8. I have alot of experience in software such as Logic Pro, Fmod and Wwise. And have worked with other
            other people on multiple small projects.

            Most of my education comes from a 2 year course I'm currently doing at <a href = "https://www.wakefield.ac.uk/study-with-us/higher-education/" target = "_blank">The University Center at Wakefield college.</a>
